## Development Configuration

### Developer Keystore

1. Open `hosts` file:
    * On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), this directory is typically `/etc/hosts`.
    * On Windows, this directory is typically `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

2. Add the following lines to the `hosts` file:
    ```text
    127.0.0.1	registryapi		# Hlæja Registry API
    ```

3. Generate Keystores
    ```shell
    keytool -genkeypair -alias registry-api -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 3650 -dname "CN=registryapi" -keypass password -keystore ./cert/keystore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass password
    ```

4. Export the public certificate
    ```shell
    keytool -export -alias registry-api -keystore ./cert/keystore.p12 -storepass password -file ./cert/registry-api.cer -rfc
    ```

### Global gradle properties

To authenticate with Gradle to access repositories that require authentication, you can set your user and token in the `gradle.properties` file.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open or create the `gradle.properties` file in your Gradle user home directory:
   - On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), this directory is typically `~/.gradle/`.
   - On Windows, this directory is typically `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.gradle\`.
2. Add the following lines to the `gradle.properties` file:
    ```properties
    repository.user=your_user
    repository.token=your_token_value
    ```
   or use environment variables `REPOSITORY_USER` and `REPOSITORY_TOKEN`
